# 🪵 StickMenu – Bedrock UI extension for the AdvancedTeleport plugin

**Stick Menu** is a lightweight plugin that lets Bedrock players open the ATP UIs from one place 🪄  
It works by extending the built-in Bedrock forms from the [Advanced Teleport](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advanced-teleport.64139/) plugin — making menus more accessible to console and mobile players
## 🧩 What It Does

- 🖱️ Right-click with a stick → opens a UI
- 🎮 Only works for Bedrock players (Java players won’t see anything)
- 🔗 Integrates with **Advanced Teleport** for UI handling and teleportation

## ✅ Requirements

- Spigot 1.20+ (Paper or Purpur recommended)
- [Advanced Teleport plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advanced-teleport.64139/)
- GeyserMC + Floodgate (for Bedrock support)

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Drop `StickMenu.jar` into your `/plugins/` folder
2. Make sure Advanced Teleport is installed and working
3. Restart your server
